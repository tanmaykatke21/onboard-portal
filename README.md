# 🚀 Onboard — Client Onboarding Portal

A full-stack SaaS platform that replaces scattered tools like HoneyBook and Dubsado — giving creative agencies a single place to onboard clients, manage projects, process payments, and deliver work.

## ✨ What It Does

**Admin** creates a client → Firebase auto-generates their account → client receives a password reset email → client logs in to their own portal → signs agreements, pays invoices, tracks project progress, downloads deliverables, and views monthly reports.

Two completely different interfaces from a single codebase — powered by role-based access control.

**Key architectural decision:** Firebase handles authentication (sessions, password hashing, Google sign-in) while MongoDB stores all business data (user profiles with roles, projects, invoices). They're linked by `firebaseUid` — giving us Firebase's simplicity with MongoDB's flexibility.

## 📦 MongoDB Schema

```
users ──────────── projects
  │                    │
  │                    ├── agreements
  │                    ├── invoices
  │                    ├── timeline
  │                    ├── deliverables
  │                    └── reports
  │
  └── firebaseUid (links to Firebase Auth)
```

| Collection | Key Fields |
|------------|------------|
| `users` | firebaseUid, name, email, role (admin/client), projectId |
| `projects` | clientId, projectName, status, currentPhase, startDate |
| `agreements` | projectId, clientId, title, terms[], status, signedAt, signatureName |
| `invoices` | projectId, invoiceNumber, items[], total, status, stripePaymentId |
| `timeline` | projectId, phase, taskName, status, dueDate |
| `deliverables` | projectId, fileName, filePath, fileSize, category, downloadCount |
| `reports` | projectId, month, year, overview, metrics{}, highlights[], nextSteps[] |

All collections are linked via MongoDB `ObjectId` references — zero data duplication.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- MongoDB Atlas account
- Firebase project (Email/Password auth enabled)
- Stripe account (test mode — free)

### 1. Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tanmaykatke21/onboard-portal.git
cd onboard-portal

# Server
cd server
npm install

# Client
cd ../client
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Setup

Create `server/.env`:
```env
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<pass>@cluster.mongodb.net/onboard
PORT=9000
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xxxxxxxxxxxx
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

Update `client/src/config/firebase.js` with your Firebase config from the Firebase Console.

### 3. Run

```bash
# Terminal 1 — Backend
cd server
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 — Frontend
cd client
npm start
```

### 4. Test

1. Open `http://localhost:3000/register` → create admin account
2. Go to Admin Dashboard → Clients → Add Client
3. Client receives password reset email → sets password → logs in
4. Client sees their portal with project info, documents, timeline

## 🧪 Stripe Test Cards

| Card Number | Result |
|-------------|--------|
| `4242 4242 4242 4242` | ✅ Successful payment |
| `4000 0000 0000 0002` | ❌ Card declined |
| `4000 0000 0000 3220` | 🔐 3D Secure required |

## 📝 Key Technical Decisions

**Why Firebase Auth + MongoDB (not just one)?**
Firebase handles the hard parts of auth (password hashing, session tokens, email verification, Google sign-in) but doesn't support custom fields like roles or project associations. MongoDB stores all business data linked by `firebaseUid`. Best of both worlds.

**Why separate collections instead of nested documents?**
Invoices, agreements, deliverables, and reports all grow independently. Keeping them in separate collections linked by `projectId` avoids MongoDB's 16MB document limit, makes queries faster, and follows relational design principles.

**Why Stripe test mode?**
Full payment infrastructure is implemented and production-ready. Switching to live mode requires only changing the API keys — no code changes needed.

---

## 🛡 Security Considerations

- Passwords are never stored — Firebase handles all credential management
- Role-based route protection on both frontend (ProtectedRoute) and backend (middleware)
- E-signatures log timestamp + IP address for audit trail
- File uploads limited to 50MB with Multer
- CORS restricted to the frontend domain
- Environment variables for all sensitive keys

---

## 📈 Future Improvements

- [ ] Real-time notifications via WebSockets
- [ ] Firebase Admin SDK for server-side token verification
- [ ] Email notifications for invoice due dates
- [ ] Stripe Elements for embedded payment form
- [ ] Admin file upload UI (currently API-only)
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline with automated testing
- [ ] Error monitoring with Sentry
